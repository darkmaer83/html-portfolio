<h1>Darkmaer's Favorite Couple of Films</h1>
<h2>My few Couple of Favs (There are many more)</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Willow</h3>
<p>My all Time favorite childhood films. It is what got me into fantasy. Warkwick Davis and Val Kilmer are just great. This is also Warwick Davis's first and I want to say only lead films, Also where he plays a character without any prosthetics</p>
<h3>Scott Pilgrim Vs The World</h3>
<p>I fell in love with this film as soon as I saw it and also made me a huge fan of Edgar Wright and his quick choppy editing style. I really like the mix of comic and video game style in this film though. Plus that it makes fun of the pretentious self absorbed people that think they're actually good people despite the fact that they are horrible.</p>
<h3>Your Name</h3>
<p>This anime shocked me as it made me feel a whole new emotion that I've never felt in any form of entertainment medium before. The emotion of longing. Longing for something that may or maybe not have ever experienced. I don't want to give the story away and I'd suggest going in blind when you watch it. The soundtrack is also just amazing. It's entirely done by the band Radwimps. The vocaled songs are great and the songs that are just music are perfect for the movie. Also did I mention the animation and art. Utter perfection. It's absolutely so beautiful. Some of the best you'll see.
